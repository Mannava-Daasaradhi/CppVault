# 🔒 C++ Password Vault

A secure, local-first password manager written in C++.

This application allows you to store and manage your passwords in a single, encrypted file on your computer. It uses a master password to encrypt your vault, so your data never leaves your machine and is never stored in plain text.


## ✨ Features

* **Local-First:** Your vault is a single `.db` file on your computer. No cloud, no servers.
* **Strong Encryption:** Uses **libsodium** for modern, secure cryptography (Argon2id for key derivation and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption).
* **Full CRUD:** **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete password entries.
* **Secure Password Generator:** Create strong, random passwords from within the app.
* **Search/Filter:** Quickly find the entry you're looking for.
* **Copy to Clipboard:** Securely copy usernames and passwords.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++17
* **Build System:** CMake
* **Package Manager:** vcpkg
* **Cryptography:** libsodium
* **UI:** Dear ImGui (with GLFW & GLAD)
* **Serialization:** nlohmann/json

## 🚀 How to Build and Run (Windows)

This guide assumes you are on Windows using Visual Studio 2019.

### 1. Prerequisites

You must have the following tools installed:

1.  **Visual Studio 2019:** Make sure to install the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.
2.  **Git:** [Download from git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3.  **CMake:** [Download from cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) (During installation, make sure to select "Add CMake to the system PATH").

### 2. Install Dependencies (vcpkg)

We will use `vcpkg` to install all the required libraries.

1.  Open a **Command Prompt** (or PowerShell).
2.  Choose a location for your development tools (e.g., `C:\dev`) and clone vcpkg:
    ```cmd
    git clone [https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git) C:\dev\vcpkg
    ```
3.  Run the vcpkg bootstrap script:
    ```cmd
    C:\dev\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    ```
4.  Install the required libraries. This is the most important step. **This will take 10-20 minutes.**
    *(This command installs the 64-bit Windows versions of all libraries)*
    ```cmd
    C:\dev\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install libsodium:x64-windows nlohmann-json:x64-windows imgui[glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]:x64-windows glfw3:x64-windows glad:x64-windows
    ```

### 3. Clone This Project

1.  Navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g., `Documents\Projects`):
    ```cmd
    cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects
    ```
2.  Clone the repository:
    ```cmd
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/CppVault.git
    cd CppVault
    ```

### 4. Configure and Build (Command Line)

You **must** use the **"Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019"** for these steps. You can find it in your Start Menu.

1.  In the "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019," navigate to the project folder:
    ```cmd
    cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects\CppVault
    ```
2.  **Configure CMake:** Run the following command. This tells CMake to create a 64-bit Visual Studio 2019 project and points it to your vcpkg libraries.
    ```cmd
    cmake -B build -S . -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\dev\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
    ```
3.  **Build (Compile) the project:**
    ```cmd
    cmake --build build
    ```

### 5. Run the Application

The final executable is now in your `build` folder.

```cmd
.\build\Debug\CppVault.exe
```
